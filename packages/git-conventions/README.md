## commit

[The Conventional Commits specification][1] is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

```js
import commit from "./lib/commit"
describe("commit", () => {
```

Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc. followed by a [...] REQUIRED terminal colon and space.

A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes

```js
  it("formats commits conventionally", () => {
    expect(commit({
      type: "feat",
      description: "improve stuff",
    })).toBe("feat: improve stuff")
  })
```

A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis

```js
  it("handles optional scopes", () => {
    expect(commit({
      type: "feat",
      scope: "sip",
      description: "improve stuff",
    })).toBe("feat(sip): improve stuff")
  })
```

A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes

A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.

```js
  const body = "you would not believe it\ncause that's what we do"

  it("handles optional body", () => {
    expect(commit({
      type: "feat",
      description: "improve stuff",
      body
    })).toBe(`feat: improve stuff\n\n${body}`)
  })
```

One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body.

```js
  const footer = "Reviewed-by: talon\naffects: packages/git-conventions"

  it("handles optional footer", () => {
    expect(commit({
      type: "feat",
      description: "improve stuff",
      body,
      footer
    })).toBe(`feat: improve stuff\n\n${body}\n\n${footer}`)
  })
})
```

### Parameters

-   `options` **[object][2]** the commit options
    -   `options.type` **[string][3]** the commit type
    -   `options.scope` **[string][3]?** the scope of the commit
    -   `options.description` **[string][3]** a terse desription of the commit
    -   `options.body` **[string][3]?** a detailed explanation of the commit
    -   `options.footer` **[string][3]?** follow a convention similar to git trailer format

Returns **[string][3]** a conventional commit

## breaking

```js
import {breaking} from "./lib/commit"
describe("breaking changes", () => {
```

a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description

```js
  it("handles a breaking change", () => {
    expect(breaking("all of it, everything")).toBe("BREAKING CHANGE: all of it, everything")
  })

  it("handles breaking changes", () => {
    expect(breaking(["all of it, everything", "it's been gutted"])).toBe("BREAKING CHANGE: all of it, everything\nBREAKING CHANGE: it's been gutted")
  })
})
```

### Parameters

-   `changes` **([string][3] \| [Array][4]&lt;[string][3]>)** the breaking change(s)

Returns **[string][3]** a conventional commit footer

## footer

```js
import {footer} from "./lib/commit"
describe("footer", () => {
```

Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).

A footerâ€™s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.

```js
  it("turns an object into a commit footer", () => {
    expect(footer({"Reviewed-by": "talon", "affects": "packages/git-conventions"})).toBe("Reviewed-by: talon\naffects: packages/git-conventions")
  })
})
```

### Parameters

-   `meta` **[object][2]** the footer keys and values

Returns **[string][3]** a conventional commit footer
